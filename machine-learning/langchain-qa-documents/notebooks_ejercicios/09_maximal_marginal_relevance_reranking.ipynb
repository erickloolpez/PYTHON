    "\n",
    "MMR es un método de re-ranking que combina la relevancia y la diversidad de los documentos recuperados. El objetivo es maximizar la relevancia de los documentos devueltos y minimizar la redundancia entre ellos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Esto puede ser útil para incrementar la habilidad de los modelos de lenguage para generar respuestas con mayor cobertura y profundidad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Su algoritmo es el siguiente:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calcular los `embeddings` para cada documento y para la consulta.\n",
    "2. Seleccionar el documento más relevante para la consulta.\n",
    "3. Para cada documento restante, calcular el promedio de similitud de los documentos ya seleccionados.\n",
    "4. Seleccionar el documento que es, en promedio, menos similar a los documentos ya seleccionados.\n",
    "5. Repitir los pasos 3 y 4 hasta que se hayan seleccionado `k` documentos. Es decir, una lista ordenada que parte del documento que más contribuye a la diversidad general hasta el documento que contribuye menos.\n",
    "\n",
    "En Langchain, el algoritmo de MMR es utilizado después de que el `retriever` ha recuperado los documentos más relevantes para la consulta. Por lo tanto, nos aseguramos que estamos seleccionando documentos diversos de un conjunto de documentos que ya son relevantes para la consulta.\n",
